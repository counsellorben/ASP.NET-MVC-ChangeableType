ChangeableType is a small project which adds a Changeable<T> class.  T can be any type.

By using Changeable<T> and the @Html.ChangeableFor extension, you will
be able to get markup which includes the appropriate EditorFor for your base 
type, a checkbox to indicate whether changes have been made, a label and
a ValidationMessageFor.
